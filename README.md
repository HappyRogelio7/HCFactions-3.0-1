# Factions

##Author
I (Irantwomiles) created this by myself, but everyone is welcomed to make a fork
of this for their own use, I just ask people not to sell this as I have provided
this for free.

##What is this?
Well this is a free HCF (Hardcore Factions) plugin that I had been working
on as a side project. This was project did not get that much "love" and some
things are just written poorly. I provided this as a base for people who couldn't 
afford a HCF plugin that would cost hundreds of dollars.

##Usage
Just drag and drop this into your plugins folder along side Vault and a economy plugin
that uses Vault for example essentials.

##Developers
This plugin is practically an API. You can add this plugin to your build path and
use the classes I've provided to access functionalities of this plugin.

###Access FactionsManager

```
FactionManager.getManager()
```

That will give you a list of all of the available methods.


###Access SystemFactionsManager

```
SystemFactionManager.getManager()
```

That will give you a list of all of the available methods.

I will update this as I add more functionalities.
